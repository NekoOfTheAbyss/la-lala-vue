If you're here, you probably wanted to learn HTML or someone decided to shove this page on your face.

Worry not, cause this is just a basic tutorial on HTML.

## So what's HTML?
HTML is just a markup language used to define the structure of a webpage. If a webpage is a human, HTML is the skeleton.

## How do I get started with HTML?
You just need a text editor and a browser to make HTML work. Nothing more. 

For a good example, open the text editor. Any text editor would do. Enter the following text and save it as a `.html` file.

```html
This is a webpage.
```

Now open this file in a browser.

Congrats, you just wrote your first ever webpage! But, doesn't it look too bland? Let's give it some style.

```html
<h1>This is a webpage</h1>
```

The `<h1>` part is what you call a tag. The tag defines what the content inside it is. There are a lot of HTML tags with different uses. Let's see how the webpage looks now.

Looking thick, ain't it? `<h1>` modifies the font of the text present within to look like a heading. 

And thus, I got lazy while writing this guide. Refer [W3Schools](https://w3schools.com) for a better tutorial. Adios.

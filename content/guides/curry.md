Curry is nice. 

## Ingredients
* Chicken (cut into smol pieces, washed)
* Sliced / Cut Onions (medium sized, 2 for the first person and 1 for every other person)
* Cut Tomatoes (around 2/3rd of the amount of onions)
* Ginger-garlic paste (it's good)
* Turmeric powder (I'm an indian dude, we add that in lotsa stuff)
* Salt (to taste)
* Red chili powder (to taste)
* Pepper (to taste)
* Curry leaves (as many as you wanna add, just not too much)
* Water (250ml to serve one person, don't add too much or you'll make soup instead of curry)

## Optional
Marinate the chicken with some salt for a while. I'm lazy so I normally skip this step.

## Cooking
* Light the stove. Place whatever utensil you're gonna use.
* Pour some oil. Wait till it's hot. 
* Throw in the onions.
* Saute onions till they're golden brown.
* Add some of the ginger-garlic paste. Your wish on how much you wanna add as long as its between 1 teaspoon and 5 teaspoons.
* Throw in the tomatoes.
* Saute till tomatoes don't smell raw.
* Throw in some curry leaves. Saute for a few seconds.
* Throw in some turmeric powder. Not too much. Just a small amound would do. 
* Add salt and chili powder. Chili powder is what gives it good color (as well as taste).
* Mix well.
* Add water. It's fine to add too many if you wanna drink curry soup instead.
* Throw in the chicken.
* Mix well.
* Close the utensil with a lid or whatever.
* Cook it till you feel like the chicken is cooked. 
* The end.

Random story generator. Not much variety yet. Still under work. Uses the random name generator as always, combined with way more random stuff. I'd say 90% of this repo runs on `Math.random()`

## Usage
```js
lala.random.genChain()
```
Accepts no parameters.

Returns a string in proper case.

Example,
```js
lala.random.genChain(); 
/*
    I'm Yeztaqte. 17 years ago, I was bitten by a snake and lost my life. Forward this story to 15 people or your grandparents will be impaled by an umbrella.
*/
```

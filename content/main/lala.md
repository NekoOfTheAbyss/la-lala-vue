**As of 19th February 2022, Lala has dropped CJS support and is now a pure ESM module. You can find older versions (before v2.0.0) as [releases](https://github.com/NekoOfTheAbyss/lala/releases/tag/v1.2.2) which support CJS (I suggest moving to ESM tho).**

A collection of random useful (probably) javascript classes and functions. I compiled them into a web app for easy use.
